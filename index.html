            <p>TrailSide Treasures & Sherpa Services</p>
            <p> TrailSide Treasures & Sherpa Services main objective is to keep hikers, climbers, Alpinists and all
                people who love outdoors informed of the proper equipment and safety measures to successfully meet any
                sort of goal that they would like to meet. More than any of that though the main goal which we strive to
                achieve is to inspire everyone who our website reaches to embrace the outdoors. Even to hopefully share
                their outdoor passion with others. However, with spreading this information and causing more people to
                be outside puts a great responsibility to keep the environment safe and to treat it with as much love as
                they would with any sort of nature because the earth is our home! </p>
